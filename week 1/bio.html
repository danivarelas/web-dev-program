                        Francisco Javier Gómez Noya (born 25 March 1983) is a Spanish triathlete. He is the winner of
                        five ITU Triathlon World Championships, he holds three ITU Triathlon World Cup titles, and won the Silver medal for
                        Spain at the 2012 Summer Olympics in men's triathlon. He has also won world titles for Ironman 70.3 and
                        XTERRA Triathlon.

                    <p>
                        Born to Spanish immigrants (both from Galicia) in Basel, Switzerland, he returned to Spain and
                        now lives in Pontevedra, Galicia.

                        Gómez took up triathlon at the age of 15 after previously playing football and competing in
                        swimming. However his career suffered a setback in 2000 when a routine medical test by the Consejo Superior de
                        Deportes (CSD) revealed an "abnormal heart valve", leading to a six-year battle between Gómez and the Spanish
                        sporting authorities regarding his right to compete internationally. He initially won this right in
                        November 2003, but he was not selected for the 2004 Summer Olympics and in 2005 the CSD banned him from international
                        and domestic competition until February 2006.

                        In the nine years from 2002 to 2010, Gómez took part in 57 ITU competitions and achieved 54 top
                        ten positions, among which are 23 first-place finishes. In 2003 and in 2008, Gómez was ITU Triathlon World
                        Champion (both under-23 and Elite categories respectively in 2003). In 2007 and 2009 he was the Elite European
                        Champion. He finished second in the World Championships in 2007 and was the runner up in 2011 ITU Sprint
                        Distance Triathlon World Championships.
